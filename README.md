# A*i*Dventure

Welcome to this **text adventure completely generated by an artificial intelligence**.
The user can choose between three different settings for his adventure. He will then be presented with a scenario in which he will have to survive by choosing from three available options. If he is unlucky and chooses the wrong option, he will die.

This personal project is a way to study the implementation of the **OpenAI API**.
- [Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction). 
- The GPT model used is **gpt-3.5-turbo**.
- Even if the implementation and use of the API in the text adventure is successful, the technical limit of token management remains as *"total tokens must be below the model's maximum limit (4096 tokens for gpt-3.5-turbo)"*. See [Managing tokens](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/managing-tokens).

The development is based on **Javascript**, its framework **[Vue Js](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#what-is-vue)**, and the implementation of **[Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)**, as well as **HTML**, **Sass**, and **Bootstrap**.
The website is made **dynamic and responsive** through the use of **customized media queries** and appropriate Bootstrap classes.
